CSC1035: Crime Reporting
=

* In  order  to  help  police  to  plan  resources  and  give  the  public  information  about burglaries in 
their local area, a crime reporting system is to be developed. Burglaries, referred to as Incidents, will be recorded   
at a particular postcode location and will record a value of the goods stolen. Different areas of the country, 
referred to as Districts, will collect data so that they can summarise by number of incidents.
